Recently i got rolled out by my new ISP. A syncronious fibre-optic connection to the Internet with 200 MBit/s. Until my phone number is not transfered from my old cable ISP (Nov 2018) i can use the fibre connection free of charge.

So for nearly one year i have the wonderful situation that i can use two ISP and only pay one. As my main firewall i plan to use a pfSense box and use that as a load-balancer.

In addition to that i have to optimize my WiFi signal from the router and several APs. So i got a TP-Link TP-WL1043ND for 15 bucks on a local fb group and flashed it with LEDE.

There is only one problem with the router from the ISP. Its a pain in the a$$. Its based on a MIPS board with OpenWRT. But totally cut back and nearly no options are left for the user. Its a Genexis Platinum 7840.
